**The Roller Coaster problem**
Problem Statement: Design and implement a multithreaded simulation of an amusement park roller coaster ride. The roller coaster has a limited capacity for passengers and can only operate for a specific number of rides before taking a break. The simulation includes the roller coaster thread and multiple passenger threads.

**Constraints**

The roller coaster has a fixed capacity for passengers on each ride.
The roller coaster can go on a maximum number of rides before taking a break.
Proper usage and handling of semaphores are crucial for correct simulation behaviour.
Proper counting and tracking of passengers are essential.
Proper thread management, joining, and synchronization are necessary for a realistic and error-free simulation.
Proper acquisition and release of semaphores ensure thread safety, preventing race conditions and ensuring correct shared resource access.
